## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0]
### Added
- Created this Changelog.
- API calls will now print potentially-useful information if $DEBUG=true

### Changed
- Improved documentation (particularly for `API.new` and `API.params_for`).
- `API.new` will no longer instantiate without any parameters, though it is less
  fussy about its parameters now.
- APIError now unescapes some HTML entities from the provided message for
improved readability.
- APIError will also pretty-print JSON responses.

## [0.1.6] - 2017-02-08
### Changed
- Minor README improvements.

### Fixed
- Action names with hyphens were broken. The methods still use underscores
instead, but the proper hyphenated names are sent to the API.

## [0.1.5] - 2017-02-07
First public release.

### Changed
- Almost everything. Reorganized layout of gem to prepare for actual release.
This is the first point of reasonable functionality/stability.

## [0.0.1] - 2017-02-07
### Added
- Initial commit, not publicly released
